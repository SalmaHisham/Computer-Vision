## Data Preparation for YOLO Object Detection

In the `Object Detection Utilities` folder, you'll find a comprehensive Python notebook that provides a set of functions for preprocessing data for YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection models. The data preparation process involves collecting data from messy folders, handling missed annotations, and organizing data for YOLO.
